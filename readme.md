## Editing Slide Content

Each header in _content.md_ is a slide. Text after the header is shown in the notes section. CSS after the header is displayed on the slide so that the reader can see it. this is referred to as the "Display CSS".

### Example Details

The CSS and HTML underneath the words "Example Details:" are combined with the Display CSS in order to render the example content. If a slide does not have "Example Details:", then it uses the example content from the previous slide and combines it with the Display CSS. The Display CSS is always rendered after the other CSS to ensure maximum precedence.
